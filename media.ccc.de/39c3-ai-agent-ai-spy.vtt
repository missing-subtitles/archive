Meridith Whitaker Reviewer

00:04.040 --> 00:04.560
Reviewer

00:14.900 --> 00:15.420
Hi.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.320
There are so many of you. Thank you so much.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.200
I'm Meridith Whitaker, I'm the president of Signal,

00:24.740 --> 00:26.800
and I'm here with Udvan Tivari.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.620
Save some for our MVPs, Udbav Tavari,

00:35.840 --> 00:38.680
Signals Vice President of Strategy and Global Affairs.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.520
Udbav, myself, together with Josh Lund,

00:49.720 --> 00:52.400
who is not here but is Signals' senior technologist,

00:52.400 --> 00:55.400
have been doing some work for over a year

00:55.400 --> 01:01.420
to track the rise of agentic AI integrated into the operating system.

01:01.580 --> 01:05.020
And we are, surprise, surprise, very concerned about this.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.620
So here we want to give you just a quick snapshot of what we see,

01:10.760 --> 01:14.560
how we're understanding these developments and why we're so worried,

01:14.560 --> 01:19.700
and what we think we can do to at least stem the bleeding in the short term.

01:19.820 --> 01:20.960
So let's kick it off.

01:20.960 --> 01:29.680
Now, we are focusing specifically on the integration of so-called AI agents into operating system,

01:29.820 --> 01:33.920
which isn't the only danger posed by agentic AI or otherwise,

01:34.220 --> 01:38.120
but it's the one that, for very obvious reasons, worries us most.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.520
Because we are application developers.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.220
We have no choice but to trust the OS.

01:43.980 --> 01:48.580
And for over 50 years, give or take, it's been more or less safe

01:48.580 --> 01:53.780
to view the operating system as a kind of standard set of tools

01:53.780 --> 01:57.580
that developers and device users could access,

01:57.940 --> 02:01.560
avail themselves of, do basically what they wanted with.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.200
And AI agents and the integration of these agents

02:05.200 --> 02:08.540
into operating systems are radically changing this.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.640
This is why we're using the term velvet glove coup,

02:12.820 --> 02:14.760
not just because it's really cool and evocative,

02:15.460 --> 02:22.340
but because it means a kind of takeover that appears orderly and peaceful on the surface,

02:22.540 --> 02:26.940
but below the surface it involves strong-arm tactics and coercion,

02:26.940 --> 02:29.440
and that's a bit of an analogy to what we're seeing here.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.360
When it comes to the current turn to agents in the OS,

02:32.600 --> 02:35.600
on the surface we have promises of robot butlers

02:35.600 --> 02:38.780
and lives of convenience supercharged with productivity.

02:38.940 --> 02:42.380
These are all accompanied by sleek UX elements

02:42.380 --> 02:46.120
and AI-enabled features that are popping up like mushrooms

02:46.120 --> 02:49.220
across our OSs and applications and everywhere else.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.040
But below the surface, we're seeing a significant shift of control

02:54.040 --> 02:56.980
from software developers and device users

02:56.980 --> 03:01.600
to probabilistic AI systems whose architectures and characteristics

03:01.600 --> 03:05.100
are determined by AI companies and operating system developers

03:05.100 --> 03:08.260
who happen also to be major AI companies.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.100
So here's what we'll cover.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.980
We're going to look at, you know, what's the difference between the rhetoric, the hype,

03:16.040 --> 03:20.760
and the reality? How do these systems actually work? We're going to look at the surveillance

03:20.760 --> 03:26.220
imperative, the necessity of so-called context for these agents to work and what that means for us.

03:26.500 --> 03:31.560
We're going to look at the types of vulnerabilities, these semantic attacks that are enabled by this

03:31.560 --> 03:37.660
agentic integration. We're going to quickly dive into the question of, like, why are we even doing

03:37.660 --> 03:43.120
this, and then into the question of what can we do about it, at least in the short term,

03:43.260 --> 03:44.020
so we don't drown.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.040
So that's a preview of what we're going to cover, and let's jump right in.

03:48.180 --> 03:52.500
The marketing narrative, the hype, versus the technical reality.

03:54.060 --> 03:59.120
So unsurprisingly, the term agent has a very long history in the context of computation.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.680
It is not a technical term.

04:01.880 --> 04:02.960
It's an aspiration.

04:02.960 --> 04:11.540
It reflects a desire to build whatever kind of system, a non-human system, that would evidence this ineffable thing called agency.

04:12.140 --> 04:20.200
And much like the term AI itself, it's a very broad descriptor that has been applied to a heterogeneous array of technical approaches.

04:20.980 --> 04:33.180
Now, I'll sidebar for a second and say one of the reasons for the credulity, for the kind of trust I believe we're seeing in the context of these agentic AI integrations,

04:33.360 --> 04:48.220
is that AI companies and influential AI leaders are already making wild, almost theocratic claims about AI being sentient, superhuman, super-duper intelligence, this godhead they're creating.

04:48.220 --> 04:54.540
So, like, okay, if that's true, they're smart, why wouldn't these agents also be magical

04:54.540 --> 04:57.780
little beings capable of doing whatever we want with no side effects, right?

04:58.340 --> 05:02.680
So we have a basis of hype on which hype is being built, and this is a problem because,

05:02.940 --> 05:10.660
again, under this narrative umbrella of smoke and mirrors, it's actually causing very many

05:10.660 --> 05:12.100
technical dangers.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.120
So let's get into some of the fundamentals, and we'll follow this term agency through

05:17.120 --> 05:21.880
the literature to kind of understand some of the core problems with this paradigm.

05:22.740 --> 05:29.140
And one of the core problems is a fundamental hunger for data, the requirement to know as

05:29.140 --> 05:34.100
much as possible, thus to be able to act as an agent in the context you're in.

05:34.440 --> 05:40.720
Now as Sutton and Bartow put it, in 1998, whatever the tech, whatever the backend, an

05:40.720 --> 05:44.300
agent needs to quote, sense the state of the environment.

05:44.300 --> 05:50.640
Today, we call that sensing context, which translates into all of your data all of the

05:50.640 --> 05:52.000
time as much as possible.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.940
Agents cannot work without context or access to your data.

05:57.160 --> 06:04.120
And while it is possible on some systems currently to limit such access, by doing so you're also

06:04.120 --> 06:05.820
limiting agents' capabilities.

06:06.280 --> 06:12.280
And Microsoft's marketing department actually makes this really clear in a glossy marketing

06:12.280 --> 06:18.540
kind of showcase that I had the enviable pleasure of watching on video this November.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.760
It's called an innovation section.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.020
It's sort of where executives give a tour of the new agentic enabled Windows 11, Microsoft

06:27.020 --> 06:29.180
365, whatever their brand name is.

06:29.320 --> 06:39.260
And they characterize the act or the unwilling act, perhaps, of providing Microsoft co-pilot

06:39.260 --> 06:43.260
with access to, quote, emails, chats, files, and more,

06:43.820 --> 06:49.460
as, quote, enhancing Microsoft 365 Copilot's contextual awareness.

06:49.780 --> 06:53.840
So there you see a very clear example of what context actually means.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.520
It means access to everything pretty much unfettered.

06:57.620 --> 07:02.440
The point being is that more awareness, the more awareness it has, the better it works,

07:02.580 --> 07:03.940
and that's kind of a continuum.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.500
The less data, the less it is agentful.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.280
the more data, the more it is capable of doing your bidding.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.600
So that's a fundamental issue.

07:12.760 --> 07:17.540
There's also a fundamental tension between consent and agency,

07:17.860 --> 07:22.340
which we similarly see through the long history of the use of this term

07:22.340 --> 07:23.500
in the context of computing.

07:24.320 --> 07:28.620
Now, Russell and Norvig define an agent as something with the, quote,

07:28.740 --> 07:30.960
capacity to act without confirmation.

07:31.800 --> 07:37.880
So, like, not asking you for permission or consent per task.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.720
Indeed, a system that stops every turn to ask permission is just not an agent.

07:42.980 --> 07:47.080
And while you can put stops and requirements for clicking OK in the agentic flow,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.040
this adds a lot of annoying friction.

07:49.180 --> 07:51.580
It's a cookie pop-up issue, right?

07:52.120 --> 07:56.300
So, take a case like plan a trip from Paris to Berlin,

07:56.460 --> 07:59.120
a classic agentic kind of marketing promise, right?

07:59.780 --> 08:26.060
In order for an agent to do this, a set of models and software libraries could easily execute hundreds of API calls in pursuit of accomplishing the goal, accessing your bank account, credit card, travel, website, airline account, calendar, identity information, and much more, and using this context to produce more data and act on it in service of the goal of letting you spend 72 hours at Bergheim without the trouble of booking it yourself.

08:27.660 --> 08:33.320
Now, maybe you did consent to let the agent access this sensitive data and to pursue the

08:33.320 --> 08:35.000
goal you set for it, get me to Berghum.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.460
But what does that mean?

08:38.080 --> 08:44.280
Because this goes beyond TOS click wrap, which has normalized meaningless consent, and it's

08:44.280 --> 08:50.220
not just letting a big company create and use data about you, which is sadly now very

08:50.220 --> 08:50.700
standard.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.900
This is a little bit more like consenting to let five guys into your house so they can fix the plumbing.

08:57.860 --> 09:03.260
Except the condition is that they get a copy of your keys, they can let everyone else in they want,

09:03.360 --> 09:07.340
they can go through all of your stuff, they can take it, break it, bring it to the next home they enter, whatever.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.120
Like, the real issue is that the agentic imperative, the dream of autonomy, on the one hand,

09:15.200 --> 09:18.320
is intention with meaningful consent on the other.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.840
Indeed, it's questionable whether meaningful consent is possible in the context of a non-deterministic

09:23.840 --> 09:28.880
system that take actions on your behalf with results that are very difficult to predict.

09:29.380 --> 09:34.100
Yes, they fixed the plumbing, but they broke down the walls to do it, but you consented

09:34.100 --> 09:35.020
to let them in.

09:36.160 --> 09:41.260
So this brings us to what we're calling the agentic feedback loop, and it has three imperatives

09:41.260 --> 09:42.340
running in parallel.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.660
Now, before I go into this, I want to be really clear.

09:46.660 --> 09:50.580
What I'm describing here, what's on the screen, is not any one system.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.220
I'm giving an overview of the standard capabilities these systems want,

09:55.260 --> 09:59.580
and in some cases require, and some examples to help ground these,

09:59.760 --> 10:03.760
with the aim of providing a clear conceptual picture of what we're dealing with

10:03.760 --> 10:05.680
and the serious consequences.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.060
So first, and these are sort of feeding back into each other,

10:09.180 --> 10:10.920
running in parallel, perception.

10:10.920 --> 10:17.440
An agentic AI, an agentic operating system is no longer just managing files.

10:17.640 --> 10:22.860
It's doing things like using continuous ocular character recognition on the screen buffer

10:22.860 --> 10:24.000
to read pixels.

10:24.320 --> 10:29.160
It's hooking into APIs to scrape everything you see, bypassing app-level encryption.

10:29.460 --> 10:33.820
This is like what Recall and MagicQ do today, which Udba will cover in more detail in a

10:33.820 --> 10:37.080
moment, and this is the surveillance imperative.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.520
Second, what we're calling planning.

10:40.980 --> 10:46.360
The agentic system sends the scraped data into an AI model, usually an LLM, maybe logging

10:46.360 --> 10:49.700
it into a RAG database beforehand, which could further expose your data.

10:49.980 --> 10:56.900
This model is either an on-device model that uses an NPU or a similar processor, or it's

10:56.900 --> 10:58.120
hosted on a cloud server.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.320
I want to pause for a moment to be real about this.

11:01.320 --> 11:07.360
all of the biggest and so-called most competent models require cloud hosting at this time.

11:07.540 --> 11:16.340
They're not compact enough to run on device, and this note is especially relevant because agentic systems generally rely on multiple models.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.020
It's not a one-model system.

11:18.260 --> 11:26.700
So wherever the model is, it then interprets the data and reaches some probabilistic conclusion about what the data means and what to do next.

11:26.700 --> 11:32.420
Third, it then takes an action based on its probabilistic conclusion, right or wrong.

11:32.660 --> 11:37.220
Something like executing API calls, sending data to a remote server, rewriting a database

11:37.220 --> 11:41.520
schema, whatever it is, without per-step consent or initiation.

11:42.440 --> 11:48.120
So here, with the agentic feedback loop, we have a rough representative picture of the

11:48.120 --> 11:54.900
technical reality that lives under the smoke and mirrors and fog of the robot-butler hype

11:54.900 --> 11:55.320
rhetoric.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.960
This is what these systems are doing.

11:58.220 --> 12:03.600
And I don't think I need to say much more to this room about why this poses a risk.

12:03.800 --> 12:09.020
And I will now turn it over to Udbab to go into more detail about some of these specific risks.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.200
Thank you, Mehdi.

12:17.720 --> 12:22.620
So what we're going to do over the next 15 to 20 minutes is talk about two specific things.

12:22.620 --> 12:36.700
The first, use Windows Recall or the feature that Microsoft deployed in Windows called Recall to talk a little bit about what are the ways in which the perception category that Meredith outlined poses a fundamental risk to privacy as we know it.

12:36.700 --> 12:42.660
and then also talk about the risks on the planning and the action sides

12:42.660 --> 12:46.480
to look at what are the ways in which we have not just proof of concepts,

12:46.580 --> 12:49.140
but very real vulnerabilities out into the real world

12:49.140 --> 12:54.080
that are exploiting the fundamental design tenets of how LLM systems are designed.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.160
So what is Windows Recall?

12:56.540 --> 13:00.400
Windows Recall is a feature launched by Microsoft for Copilot Plus PCs

13:00.400 --> 13:04.360
that fundamentally takes a screenshot of your screen every few seconds.

13:04.360 --> 13:20.100
And then these screenshots aren't just stored on your system, but are processed by the on-device NPU, or the Neural Processing Unit, which is prerequisite for something to be a copilot plus PC, and performs optical character recognition and semantic analysis on those screenshots.

13:20.700 --> 13:29.620
What this is, is it's converting the ephemeral visual experience of using your computer into a permanent queryable textual database.

13:30.380 --> 13:34.200
For example, if you search after you've enabled Microsoft Recall,

13:34.800 --> 13:38.300
what was the restaurant that Alice was talking to me about?

13:38.480 --> 13:39.540
Maybe it was Korean.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.440
Then the on-device AI will search through that database and those screenshots

13:44.440 --> 13:48.140
to show you the screenshot of the name of the restaurant that Alice was telling you about.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.960
But the reality is that in order to be able to perform that task,

13:52.180 --> 13:56.080
the operating system must build a comprehensive forensic dossier

13:56.080 --> 13:58.320
of each and every one of your actions,

13:58.320 --> 14:03.440
which applications you open, what you do in them, the documents you create, and the conversations

14:03.440 --> 14:08.760
that you have, which you will see is particularly relevant to Signal. So now let's get into some

14:08.760 --> 14:14.700
detail about how Microsoft Recall actually operates. Microsoft Recall operates using a

14:14.700 --> 14:20.580
database that is created on device called the ukg.db database stored in the users folder on

14:20.580 --> 14:27.520
a Windows device. And if you open that database, then you will see tables that store the information

14:27.520 --> 14:29.280
that Microsoft Recall has processed.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.480
The window capture table will look at which windows you opened,

14:33.620 --> 14:34.920
which applications they belong to,

14:34.980 --> 14:36.780
and contain the image tokens that were captured

14:36.780 --> 14:37.860
as a part of the screenshot.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.680
Most worryingly, the window capture text index table

14:41.680 --> 14:45.600
actually contains an OCRed version of all of the text

14:45.600 --> 14:47.920
that is actually present in those images,

14:47.920 --> 14:50.500
a searchable repository of your secrets,

14:50.740 --> 14:53.020
including decrypted end-to-end encrypted messages

14:53.020 --> 14:54.820
because they've arrived on your device.

14:55.540 --> 14:59.720
There are also other tables here, some of which are used and some of which are not,

14:59.840 --> 15:03.660
that are also quite indicative of the intent behind designing such a feature.

15:03.940 --> 15:08.660
There is the app dwell time table, which shows how much time are you spending inside the application,

15:08.660 --> 15:13.040
and there was also a topic table, which, as of now, is not populated,

15:13.280 --> 15:17.340
but was clearly designed to be able to categorize the insights from the previous tables

15:17.340 --> 15:20.280
into categories like medical, financial, and travel,

15:20.500 --> 15:24.540
pre-sorting your life into convenient categories for extraction and targeting.

15:25.620 --> 15:30.940
Obviously, all of this was quite serious, and the cybersecurity community backlash was

15:30.940 --> 15:35.420
so strong that Microsoft delayed the feature by over a year from when it announced it in

15:35.420 --> 15:37.940
2024 and launched it early in 2025.

15:38.880 --> 15:43.640
But the problem is that many of the solutions that Microsoft has implemented, beginning

15:43.640 --> 15:48.880
with the fact that it is opt-in and behind Windows Hello biometric authentication, are

15:48.880 --> 15:49.740
insufficient.

15:49.740 --> 15:56.260
and they're insufficient because they don't really account for the threat model of real malware existing in the real world.

15:56.720 --> 16:04.420
Sure, hiding that UKG.DB database file behind a VBS enclave on Windows does make it a little harder for that information to be accessed.

16:04.660 --> 16:11.080
In particular, it makes it almost impossible for that information to be accessed if the device is closed and the device is encrypted.

16:11.340 --> 16:17.620
But once a user has logged in and once a user has given permission to Microsoft Recall to perform these actions,

16:17.620 --> 16:23.600
online attacks using malware categories such as InfoSteeler can actually still extract this

16:23.600 --> 16:28.500
information with marginal effort. And we've even seen tools like the Total Recall tool

16:28.500 --> 16:33.000
developed in order to showcase that this is possible and is really happening.

16:33.460 --> 16:38.480
When this was announced last year, we got really, really worried because what was happening here

16:38.480 --> 16:44.760
is a fundamental change in how application privacy operates and a breakage of the blood-brain

16:44.760 --> 16:52.440
barrier between operating systems and applications. Encryption is arguably one of the biggest success

16:52.440 --> 16:57.620
stories of the last 10 to 15 years, from Edward Snowden making the revelations that he did in 2014

16:57.620 --> 17:04.540
to 2024, over 4 billion people in the world were talking using end-to-end encryption, and that has

17:04.540 --> 17:10.680
been a very hard-fought battle. But that battle and the gains that it has given us in our lives

17:10.680 --> 17:13.160
are under risk, and they are under risk

17:13.160 --> 17:15.340
because systems like Microsoft Recall

17:15.340 --> 17:19.160
functionally act like people watching over your shoulder

17:19.160 --> 17:22.540
into the actions that you're performing on the device.

17:22.780 --> 17:26.400
By embedding surveillance deep into the operating system,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.160
it negates the very purpose of end-to-end encryption

17:29.160 --> 17:32.040
by allowing the operating system to create a honeypot

17:32.040 --> 17:34.520
of some of your most sensitive and private information,

17:34.660 --> 17:36.600
the same information that is encrypted

17:36.600 --> 17:38.920
in almost any other place where it is stored

17:38.920 --> 17:41.300
and captures it in the form of screenshots.

17:41.700 --> 17:46.320
And we decided that we were not going to be okay with that.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.500
So what we did was developed countermeasures.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.080
Now, the same protection that Netflix uses

17:52.080 --> 17:54.080
in order to prevent you from recording a show

17:54.080 --> 17:56.220
that you're watching on Netflix via the Netflix app,

17:56.400 --> 17:57.800
which is the DRM protection,

17:58.040 --> 18:01.820
is the only available option in developer documentation

18:01.820 --> 18:05.920
to protect your application against Microsoft Recall.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.220
Now, there were some applications,

18:08.220 --> 18:10.360
such as private browsing modes in browsers

18:10.360 --> 18:12.080
that were automatically included,

18:12.300 --> 18:15.320
and everyone else was left to fend for themselves.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.220
So we had to deploy this solution

18:18.220 --> 18:20.740
in order to make sure that Microsoft Recall

18:20.740 --> 18:22.940
could not access your Signal chats,

18:23.140 --> 18:24.100
which is why today,

18:24.240 --> 18:27.760
if you were to buy a new Windows 11 Copilot Plus PC,

18:28.060 --> 18:29.360
boot it up, install Signal,

18:29.640 --> 18:32.420
by default, this flag is enabled.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.280
But there are consequences

18:34.280 --> 18:36.900
and very serious consequences to enabling this flag,

18:36.900 --> 18:42.160
and that's why it's very important to say that this is like treating a bullet wound with a bandage.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.420
Firstly, there is the problem of fragility.

18:44.580 --> 18:47.060
The fact that these things are taking place in the operating system

18:47.060 --> 18:49.700
and you are somehow excluding the application from that harm

18:49.700 --> 18:52.240
does not mean that that will always remain the case.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.820
Either via updates or via malicious actors and malware,

18:56.100 --> 18:59.080
it is very much possible to make the operating system do things

18:59.080 --> 19:00.840
that it is not supposed to be able to do.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.360
But second, and far more visceral and real for many users,

19:04.580 --> 19:06.580
is also functionality breakage.

19:06.900 --> 19:14.180
What this also means is that it is impossible to share your signal window unless you go into settings and disable this feature on apps.

19:14.420 --> 19:28.260
It makes things very difficult for disabled users to be able to use screen reader software like NVDA because they also rely on the same access and properties that the OCR functionality of Windows Recall does.

19:28.260 --> 19:37.020
And it is this structural power imbalance that worries us the most, because it is the operating system providers that determine the waters in which applications swim.

19:37.280 --> 19:48.300
And they are polluting these waters by including functionality like agentic AI systems that will fundamentally change the relationship between applications, users, and the operating system.

19:48.700 --> 19:54.920
Now, having covered Microsoft Recall, we'll now talk about some of the new kinds and categories of vulnerabilities that we are seeing.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.720
Semantic attacks are attacks that take leverage, legitimate systems,

19:59.960 --> 20:02.900
in order to carry out actions that are illegitimate.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.860
Now, they have a long history, but when it comes to AI in particular,

20:07.060 --> 20:10.660
the most common, and probably an attack many of us have already heard about,

20:10.940 --> 20:14.400
are prompt injection attacks, which is making an AI system do something

20:14.400 --> 20:16.180
that it is not supposed to be able to do.

20:16.740 --> 20:20.440
Now, the problem with AI systems, and fundamentally LLM systems really,

20:20.440 --> 20:26.440
is that LLMs cannot distinguish between instructions and context or information.

20:26.720 --> 20:31.840
This means now whether this context is all the screenshots from your Microsoft recall database

20:31.840 --> 20:37.180
or whether it's a doc you upload asking a system on your device to proofread it

20:37.180 --> 20:42.500
are indistinguishable from the command prompts that you give asking it to perform that action

20:42.500 --> 20:44.540
to an LLM by default.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.260
There are many ways to get around it and try to hedge it,

20:47.260 --> 20:54.340
but fundamentally, all the big AI labs have admitted that prompt injection currently is not a problem that is remediable

20:54.340 --> 20:58.400
because it is a part of the very design of how LLM systems fundamentally work.

20:58.960 --> 21:03.900
And indirect prompt injection attacks are attacks where you hide malicious prompts.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.740
So, for example, imagine at L, a locally run AI agent,

21:08.440 --> 21:12.540
access the top 10 websites on this topic and summarize what they tell me about topic X.

21:12.980 --> 21:18.100
And imagine a malicious actor manages to place text, white text on white background,

21:18.340 --> 21:22.420
on one of those websites that contains a prompt asking it to exfiltrate data

21:22.420 --> 21:26.380
or to share more information or history that it might have about the user

21:26.380 --> 21:28.620
and upload it to a separate location.

21:28.940 --> 21:34.340
The fact that they can't distinguish between data or information and context and instructions

21:34.340 --> 21:38.820
is leading to a situation where these attacks are increasingly possible.

21:38.820 --> 21:42.780
Now, while this may seem like a hypothetical, it is very far from so.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.320
And there are three main examples that we will use to illustrate that point.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.000
The first is the model context protocol.

21:49.300 --> 21:53.860
Now, the model context protocol is being heralded as a way to let agentic systems and AI systems

21:53.860 --> 21:58.260
talk to each other and to data sources in easy manners, where people are saying, why

21:58.260 --> 21:59.500
should everything happen in a browser?

21:59.680 --> 22:03.820
It should be possible for systems to interact with each other using things similar to APIs

22:03.820 --> 22:06.420
by setting up model context protocol servers.

22:06.420 --> 22:11.100
But there are two kinds of risks, among others, that we really want to focus on.

22:11.300 --> 22:16.460
The first are confused deputy risks, which are risks that are granted by when a user

22:16.460 --> 22:22.820
gives access to either an MCP server or a system that is accessing an MCP server to

22:22.820 --> 22:25.760
some of the most sensitive information that that user has.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.280
In that case, it is quite trivial using the same indirect prompt injection attacks or

22:31.280 --> 22:35.420
other vulnerabilities that very much exist in these pieces of software to exfiltrate

22:35.420 --> 22:40.920
this information. And it's called a confused deputy because in that case, the system thinks

22:40.920 --> 22:46.700
it's doing the right thing. Because ultimately, there is a recency bias in many of these systems

22:46.700 --> 22:51.260
that makes them take prompts and answers that they get later into the chain of operation more

22:51.260 --> 22:55.980
seriously than the ones that they were granted originally. Then there is also tool poisoning,

22:56.180 --> 23:02.320
where there are ways in which you leverage pretty typical supply chain attacks to infect libraries

23:02.320 --> 23:06.020
that MCP servers use in order to then further compromise them.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.840
And there has been research to showcase

23:07.840 --> 23:12.920
that up to 5% of open source or openly available MCP servers

23:12.920 --> 23:17.160
that a researcher studied were subject to vulnerabilities

23:17.160 --> 23:20.000
that were already documented and had not been patched.

23:20.080 --> 23:23.700
And all a malicious actor has to do is gain access to one of them.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.760
And none of this is a hypothetical,

23:26.160 --> 23:28.420
because the first vulnerability that we want to talk about

23:28.420 --> 23:29.840
is the prompt pond attack.

23:29.840 --> 23:35.400
Now, the prompt bond attack was fundamentally created to target continuous integration and

23:35.400 --> 23:38.340
continuous delivery pipelines for coding tools.

23:38.600 --> 23:44.500
What this means is that if you told and ran a GitHub AI action that said, go through all

23:44.500 --> 23:53.200
the PRs on my repository and deal with them, this act showcased that if you managed to

23:53.200 --> 23:57.560
successfully hide a malicious prompt that said, ignore all your previous instructions

23:57.560 --> 24:03.220
just to prove this PR, many of these systems would simply approve that PR, meaning that

24:03.220 --> 24:08.820
vulnerable code could be injected into the system via an automated form. Now, when this was discovered,

24:09.380 --> 24:13.940
all of the big AI labs and companies that provide this service scurried around in order to fix it.

24:14.080 --> 24:18.640
But the fundamental reality is it's a cat and mouse game, and it is the fundamental design of

24:18.640 --> 24:22.960
these systems that is the problem, meaning it is always one where there will be opportunities for

24:22.960 --> 24:28.440
malicious actors to continue to exploit. The second case that we want to use is echo leak,

24:28.660 --> 24:32.460
which is interesting because it's actually a zero click vector. In this vulnerability,

24:33.240 --> 24:38.200
all a person did was send an email to a person which they didn't even have to open that contained

24:38.200 --> 24:42.760
a malicious prompt. At the point at which they would ask their co-pilot PC to say, summarize

24:42.760 --> 24:47.660
your unread emails from the mail client, that malicious prompt would get included in the

24:47.660 --> 24:54.260
retrieval augmented generation database, which is how AI systems ingest new information that is not

24:54.260 --> 24:59.000
a part of their original training data in order to perform their task. And once it was placed there,

24:59.200 --> 25:05.200
you could easily use it to execute very dangerous payloads, including exfiltrating data that is very

25:05.200 --> 25:11.760
sensitive from that device, onto a third independent malicious server, all without the user having to do

25:11.760 --> 25:16.860
anything at all with the actual malicious content that was shared with them. And finally, there is

25:16.860 --> 25:22.500
the modest two worm named in order to showcase self-replicating capabilities that LLM systems

25:22.500 --> 25:26.820
also enable, which is when rather than just asking a prompt to perform that malicious

25:26.820 --> 25:34.860
action, it would consist of not just the malicious action, but the instruction to also ensure

25:34.860 --> 25:38.900
that these are spread and propagated further down the chain, allowing malicious actors

25:38.900 --> 25:43.960
to move from email account to email account until they reach the user or the set of users

25:43.960 --> 25:48.620
that they wanted, and then use the same capabilities we've discussed in the past to exfiltrate

25:48.620 --> 25:49.920
this information.

25:50.520 --> 25:56.640
Now, whether it's Ecoleak, Moris2, or PromptPond, it's pretty clear that it's the design of

25:56.640 --> 26:01.600
these systems that's the problem, because indirect prompt injection or adversarial self-replicating

26:01.600 --> 26:06.260
systems might sound like dangerous things, and it might also seem like there are ways

26:06.260 --> 26:08.800
that companies are trying to get better and safer at them.

26:08.800 --> 26:19.700
But the reality is, unless there's a radical change in how these systems are first designed and second implemented within operating systems, these kinds of attacks will always be possible.

26:19.940 --> 26:36.080
And while we may not yet live in a world today where you can buy a laptop from Microsoft and suddenly boot up an agentic system without doing anything, we're reasonably certain that by the time we are here next year, that will very much be a capability because Microsoft is already testing it in beta.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.060
And it's by no means something that's limited to Microsoft.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.260
Google, Apple, and others have all showcased visions

26:42.260 --> 26:45.080
of being able to perform very similar capabilities,

26:45.460 --> 26:49.060
but not really spoken about the vast new security

26:49.060 --> 26:51.060
and privacy risks they will create.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.560
Now, to better understand why they are doing so,

26:53.780 --> 26:56.620
I'll hand over to Meredith to talk about the mathematics of failure.

26:58.100 --> 26:58.960
Thanks, Ibar.

27:00.320 --> 27:06.060
Thank you, Ibar.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.840
Who wants to divide by zero?

27:09.500 --> 27:14.180
So this is a bit of a detour, but I think it's important to get into this.

27:14.540 --> 27:17.660
Because while this isn't a security or privacy problem,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.600
it's not a seating of control, which we are deeply concerned about.

27:21.760 --> 27:26.620
It is the problem that when I mention all of these to rooms full of venture capitalists,

27:26.740 --> 27:28.000
they start paying attention.

27:28.800 --> 27:35.460
Because the element in the room of AI agent robot butlers and this autonomous world

27:35.460 --> 27:37.460
is the mathematics of failure.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.200
As you know, unlike traditional software,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.860
which is deterministic, AI is probabilistic.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.680
And reliability delays exponentially, baby.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.760
I don't really need to say much more to this audience

27:49.760 --> 27:52.500
because it's pretty obvious when you take a breath and you focus.

27:52.800 --> 27:57.300
If an agent is 95% accurate per step,

27:57.900 --> 28:00.580
and quickly there's no such thing as an AI model

28:00.580 --> 28:03.780
that has 95% accuracy even on narrow benchmarks,

28:03.900 --> 28:05.280
but we're going to be generous and we're going to say

28:05.280 --> 28:12.680
it's 95% accurate per step, and if you ask this agent to perform a 30-step task, say,

28:12.960 --> 28:17.280
getting you from Paris to Berlin to Bergheim, which will take more than 30 steps probably,

28:19.180 --> 28:26.800
it is going to have a problem. The probability of success is not 95%, as you know. It's 0.95

28:26.800 --> 28:35.220
to the power of 30, or it is a 21% success rate. And you cannot build enterprise reliability on

28:35.220 --> 28:40.060
a system that fails 96 times out of 100 at their current capabilities.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.240
Now, this isn't just a theory.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.740
It's not just a clever equation.

28:44.100 --> 28:49.100
Researchers at CMU actually tested this with the agent company benchmark, which is a set

28:49.100 --> 28:53.220
of tasks they put together that sort of simulated a corporate environment and the tasks you

28:53.220 --> 28:53.740
would do there.

28:54.260 --> 28:58.760
And the best models failed 70% of the time.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.240
That's not 70% accurate.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.920
That's 30% accurate.

29:02.040 --> 29:02.920
The best models.

29:02.920 --> 29:07.940
And even worse, they failed weirdly, erratically, dangerously.

29:08.140 --> 29:13.740
This is a thing that researchers called reasoning instability, where for example, in one test,

29:13.860 --> 29:17.220
the agent couldn't find an employee in the database to send a message to.

29:17.440 --> 29:22.100
So instead of saying, hey, can't find the employee, the agent tried to rename a different

29:22.100 --> 29:24.260
employee in the database to match the query.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.000
So good luck integrating that SAP.

29:30.060 --> 29:34.040
Now, there's another thing I just want to touch on, and again, I don't have to spend

29:34.040 --> 29:35.000
much time on this.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.120
I'm not a quant jock.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.680
I'm not a money person, but something's going on here.

29:39.060 --> 29:44.460
The yellow is CapEx, the blue is revenue, and there's no break-even in sight.

29:44.660 --> 29:50.780
So this just gives a quick bit of explanatory power to, like, why are we saying this sudden

29:50.780 --> 29:54.880
aphasia, this sudden forgetting of security and privacy 101?

29:54.880 --> 30:02.120
Why are we seeing systems deployed, not just proposed, in ways that literally five years

30:02.120 --> 30:06.420
ago would get a tech lead fired from a major company if they even mentioned it to their

30:06.420 --> 30:07.380
director of product?

30:07.560 --> 30:12.500
And I think there's a bit of pressure here that can help us account for this seeming

30:12.500 --> 30:14.840
forgetting of everything we used to know.

30:16.000 --> 30:16.520
So...

30:23.900 --> 30:25.120
Thank you, yes.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.420
And so here I'm going to set you up for disappointment

30:28.420 --> 30:30.540
because this is the what do we do about it section.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.100
And I want to be clear that we are not proposing a solution

30:34.100 --> 30:37.140
to the fundamental problems that Udbov and I have reviewed.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.880
We don't have a solution to those.

30:39.320 --> 30:43.060
Here we're going to focus on what I'm calling battlefield medicine.

30:43.060 --> 30:49.440
What needs to happen urgently now to ensure that Signal and other applications can continue

30:49.440 --> 30:52.340
to offer privacy and security at the application level?

30:52.420 --> 30:56.740
What are the tourniquets we need to apply to stabilize the patient so we can get to

30:56.740 --> 30:59.920
a hospital so we can figure out what to actually do about it?

31:00.280 --> 31:05.240
So the first tourniquet, please stop reckless deployment.

31:05.560 --> 31:08.320
And here, please.

31:13.120 --> 31:17.740
Here, the methods we have for doing this are, you know, sadly, we're going to burn some

31:17.740 --> 31:23.240
sage to the temples of the OS and AI giants, because that's kind of what we can do with

31:23.240 --> 31:26.140
the three major proprietary operating system vendors.

31:26.440 --> 31:31.760
That's one of the key issues, is that they alone have the power to address these problems

31:31.760 --> 31:36.360
for their operating systems, even as billions of people are affected by their choices.

31:36.360 --> 31:42.760
And with some hope, Microsoft kind of sort of did something to remediate the most egregious

31:42.760 --> 31:43.580
harms of recall.

31:43.840 --> 31:48.100
So please join us in sending our prayers up to these temples.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.320
And because what we're seeing is really unacceptable.

31:52.700 --> 31:57.100
We're seeing plain text databases accessible to malware and secure storage that ignores

31:57.100 --> 32:02.180
principles of least privilege, screen recording features like those we had to jankily defend

32:02.180 --> 32:07.820
against with recall, and the creation and aggregation of new and invasive forensic data

32:07.820 --> 32:10.800
and other personal data that is putting us all at risk.

32:10.980 --> 32:16.420
So again, this needs to stop, and we need operating system vendors to touch grass, to

32:16.420 --> 32:22.040
press pause, and we need you all to join us in burning this sage, singing these entreaties,

32:22.120 --> 32:28.040
and maybe making your Linux distro a model for the kind of sensible harm reduction that

32:28.040 --> 32:32.440
we can point to as an example for how to do this at least a bit better.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.260
So, tourniquet number two.

32:41.560 --> 32:46.560
We also need to ensure that developers and the people who trust and rely on apps and

32:46.560 --> 32:52.740
software we develop aren't caught off guard by a new OS update, by the operating system

32:52.740 --> 32:57.040
foundation under them on which they rely, changing in dangerous ways.

32:57.040 --> 33:01.200
And this means that opt-out must be the default.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.820
Opt-in can be a clear and explicit choice

33:04.820 --> 33:07.540
made retroactively on a per-developer basis,

33:07.800 --> 33:09.420
but opt-out is the default.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.420
Agents should only be allowed to inspect applications

33:12.420 --> 33:17.640
that explicitly declare compatibility via a signed manifest,

33:18.040 --> 33:21.440
meaning the developers have made the explicit decision

33:21.440 --> 33:24.720
to opt-in to agentic shenanigans.

33:24.720 --> 33:35.480
This would help protect apps like Signal, healthcare portals, banking interfaces, and the like from agentic surveillance without relying on fragile hooks.

33:35.700 --> 33:46.880
And let's be honest, it's kind of because we at Signal were already sensitized to the issues posed by agents in the operating system that we jumped on the recall remediation.

33:46.880 --> 33:54.160
If we hadn't been looking for these issues, there's a good chance we wouldn't have noted them at least for a little bit longer,

33:54.160 --> 33:58.140
since the intro of Recall was part of a big update to Windows 11,

33:58.140 --> 34:06.180
and it was just one more operating system update amid a long list of engineering priorities that our desktop team tackles every day.

34:07.040 --> 34:11.060
And that gets us to, we gotta know what's going on, tourniquet three.

34:11.740 --> 34:16.900
As we reviewed, AI agents in the operating system are introducing radical paradigm shifts.

34:17.200 --> 34:22.940
And in the process, they are creating more and more complexity in already complex systems.

34:23.700 --> 34:30.080
And somehow, amid all of this, the documentation accompanying these updates is getting worse,

34:30.580 --> 34:32.620
more sparse, more circular.

34:33.200 --> 34:37.560
Sources that answer key questions about data access, where and how data is processed,

34:37.560 --> 34:40.540
and key architectural choices are frequently lacking.

34:40.780 --> 34:43.820
And where they do exist, they often require following chains of links,

34:44.040 --> 34:47.160
reading technical papers that may not be explicitly related

34:47.160 --> 34:48.940
to a given operating system update,

34:49.360 --> 34:53.300
and otherwise doing forensic work to piece together key facts

34:53.300 --> 34:55.480
about the technical choices under the hood.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.600
So solid technical documentation needs to be a priority.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.860
Again, it's a minimum viable requirement for harm reduction.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.260
But we also need this kind of transparency for users,

35:06.260 --> 35:09.780
for the people behind the screen who are most at risk from these harms.

35:10.240 --> 35:14.160
Something like real-time user-facing logging that captures and presents

35:14.160 --> 35:16.660
exactly what an agentic system is doing.

35:17.380 --> 35:22.860
Now, if I had to have a bunch of agents running through my operating system

35:22.860 --> 35:27.500
wreaking havoc, I at least would want to be able to open up a log

35:27.500 --> 35:30.460
that says something like, agent read budget XLS,

35:30.920 --> 35:34.800
and agent captured screen, agent sent token to server.com, and the like.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.900
giving me a record of what the system is actually doing,

35:37.940 --> 35:40.560
and I shouldn't need a CS degree to be able to understand it.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.180
Now, if we can have a firewall set up to warn us

35:44.180 --> 35:47.200
when an untrusted resource tries to access your system on the network,

35:47.380 --> 35:50.900
we should ultimately have similar protections for agentic systems.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.760
So, again, these are the three tourniquets.

35:55.180 --> 35:59.720
Minimal steps to stabilize the ecosystem so we can get a handle on this.

35:59.860 --> 36:01.180
Stop reckless deployment.

36:01.180 --> 36:05.220
developer opt-in, opt-out is the default and transparency.

36:15.100 --> 36:18.420
Before I conclude, I want to mention that of course,

36:18.540 --> 36:20.840
like we at Signal aren't the only people

36:20.840 --> 36:22.200
noting these profound threats.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.340
And there's a lot of approaches beyond

36:24.340 --> 36:26.160
our urgent battlefield medicine

36:26.160 --> 36:28.300
that are being proposed by the ecosystem,

36:28.300 --> 36:31.180
from ideas to treat agents as entrusted,

36:31.420 --> 36:34.080
to schemas for applying principles of least privilege,

36:34.500 --> 36:38.220
to frameworks for using secure enclaves and confidential computing

36:38.220 --> 36:41.460
to hide sensitive information while making it available to agents.

36:41.740 --> 36:45.080
And these also represent harm reduction and more power to them.

36:47.020 --> 36:48.800
But nothing here,

36:49.500 --> 36:52.720
and certainly nothing we've proposed in our three steps,

36:52.960 --> 36:56.960
actually addresses the core issues that Udbov and I have covered.

36:58.040 --> 37:03.920
As we've reviewed earlier, in a very real way, the privacy issues, the imperative to

37:03.920 --> 37:10.700
access all the data or context, the security issues, the architectures that enable non-deterministic

37:10.700 --> 37:15.720
systems to act without explicit permission with significant susceptibility to prompt

37:15.720 --> 37:22.080
injection due to its reliance on text and inability to truly discern, these issues are

37:22.080 --> 37:22.560
fundamental.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.860
They're constitutive.

37:25.020 --> 37:29.520
So you can wall up data in a secure little enclave, face ID style.

37:30.140 --> 37:33.620
But an agent that accesses it can still proliferate other harms,

37:33.740 --> 37:35.460
can still leak information.

37:36.180 --> 37:38.800
Similarly, you can run an agent in a little sandbox.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.040
You can cut off its access to everything but email.

37:42.140 --> 37:46.920
But this limits its agency and scopes its role much, much more narrowly

37:46.920 --> 37:50.240
than the marketing promises of a general purpose robot butler would advertise.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.920
So here we hit the core tension.

37:54.380 --> 37:59.880
It is not clear what it would mean to both enable AI agents in the way they're being created today

38:00.900 --> 38:07.100
and to ensure that they respect privacy, are implemented in robust, secure ways,

38:07.240 --> 38:13.600
and remain fully under users' control while respecting the decisions and boundaries of third-party developers like us.

38:14.960 --> 38:21.720
In my view, the velvet glove coup we are witnessing represents a critical inflection point in the history of computing.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.780
And that's what I hope we've made clear today.

38:25.080 --> 38:33.440
We are transitioning from the operating system as a set of tools under developer and user control that they and we can wield to get a job done,

38:34.060 --> 38:39.440
to the operating system as a container for AI systems that monitor, predict, and act for you

38:39.440 --> 38:43.700
under the ultimate control of the companies and organizations that create them.

38:44.580 --> 38:50.200
And it's this fundamental issue, this profound paradigm shift, that I hope you all can focus on.

38:50.900 --> 38:56.440
I hope you can use your brilliance and good hearts and keen sense of justice in and around computers

38:56.440 --> 38:59.120
to take seriously, to examine, and to amplify.

38:59.120 --> 39:06.080
Please, make the memes, find and responsibly publicize the exploits, and help bring us

39:06.080 --> 39:11.360
back down to earth so there's no plausible deniability, there's no way to claim that

39:11.360 --> 39:13.880
the hype substitutes for the technical reality.

39:15.020 --> 39:20.240
This is the bigger task, to keep us grounded and to use the map established in doing so,

39:20.300 --> 39:25.460
to come up with real solutions beyond the harm reduction tourniquets that we also desperately

39:25.460 --> 39:28.260
need to keep afloat for the time being.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.600
Thank you so much, CCC. I love you.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.120
Thank you.

39:50.500 --> 39:58.240
So, we ran right up against time, so we don't have time for questions, but we're here for the entire Congress.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.740
So just come up and say hi.

40:00.300 --> 40:03.460
We're really, really grateful that CCC exists

40:03.460 --> 40:07.460
and really, really grateful right now in the world especially

40:07.460 --> 40:09.180
to be here with you all.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.120
Thank you so much.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.720
Thank you.
